This is a Kick starter pack for machine leaning

This will simply allow you to use machine learning with a very little background knowledge. The approach here is to build a light weight machine learning engine with some of the most commonly used clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical, BFR and CURE. So you can decide which algorithm matches your case.
